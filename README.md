A Website Augmented Reality for Science Education

Project Description
This project allows the student to learn Science in an easier and more fun way through Web AR. The web AR uses a camera to scan an image that shows the different organs of the body, layers of the earth, plants and animals then it can be seen in a 3D form. And along with the 3D image of the organisms it also shows the brief definition or explanation of that organism. 

Market Analysis
This project aims for schools or academies to provide effective learning materials for the students from elementary and secondary. And this could also benefit the teachers, where they can use the AR as an aide material for their lesson.The advantage of the web AR is that it can be accessed by any of the students and it helps their memory skills to remember the lesson.

Technical Specifications
These are the steps that can be taken to complete this project:
Planning & Determining the Requirements(June 22-23)
Designing(June 24-25)
Building the System (Jun26- Jul5)
Testing (Jul 6 -7)
Deployment (Jul 8-9)
Maintenance (Jul 10-12)

Risk Analysis
The potential risk of this project is that creating AR system experiments is challenging and lacks virtual ongoing professional development. The development of an educational AR system is time consuming. The teaching experience might be a risk too, some teachers are insufficient in training for dealing with technology.
